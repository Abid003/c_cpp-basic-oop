/*11.	Write a program to find out (the hard way, by counting
them) how many of the numbers from 1 to 10 are greater than 3.
(The answer, of course, should be 7.) Your program should have a
loop which steps a variable (probably named i) over the
10 numbers. Inside the loop, if i is greater than 3, add one to a second
variable which keeps track of the count. At the end of the program,
 after the loop has finished, print out the count. */
